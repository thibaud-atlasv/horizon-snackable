That's... that's good.

Nighttime. When I'm all alone.

    I just said the most important thing of my life and you...

    No. It's ok. People do that.
    They pull away when it's too much.

    Come back when you're ready.

I have a dream.
...
It's silly. It's a little kid's dream.
...
I want a friend who stays.
Even knowing everything.
The spines. The poison. The fact that I talk too much.
The fact that I cry at night.
...
Who stays anyway.
...
And comes back the next day.
...
You do that.
You do exactly that.
...
Trust me. It's more than I deserve.

    Just to be clear.
    Pufferfish cry with bubbles.

    Well I think. I'd never cried from happiness before.

I'm gonna tell you something.
...
I counted.
You've come back... a lot of times.
Every time I count.
...
And every time, the morning before you arrive...
My heart beats faster.
...
Not from fear.
From... what actually?
...
Hope I think.
For the first time in my life.
Hope.

    You gave me that.

Fugu isn't my real name.

My real name is the one my family gave me.
Before they left.
...
But Fugu is the name I chose for myself.
Because it's what I am.
A pufferfish.
Dangerous on the outside.
...
But on the inside...
...
Just a little fish who wants to be loved.

There. Now you know everything.
Absolutely everything.

I'll be with you forever.

A real one.
