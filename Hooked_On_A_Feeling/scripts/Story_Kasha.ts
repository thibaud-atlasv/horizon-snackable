So you're the new face.
Everyone's been whispering about it.

    Stay.

So. Things you should know.
Rule one: I'm the loudest person around here. That's not up for debate. That's a fact.
Rule two: nobody — and I mean nobody — has ever bested me.
I am the champion. Of this corner. By right.
Rule three: don't bother trying. You'll embarrass yourself.
Rule four: if you do try, do it well, because if you embarrass yourself I'll have to mock you and I'm tired today.

Why are you smiling.

    ...That's a real prize.
    Stop smirking.

Answer carefully.

That was a slight exaggeration.
Slight.

Hey.
...
I'm going to do something today.
I'm going to be quiet.
Just for a minute.
Don't panic. I'll be loud again. I just want to try it.

* [WAIT] #delta:5 #expr:warm #icon:warmth #flag:mood.kasha.shared_silence
    ...
    Thank you.
    ...
    I think I want to keep being quiet for a while.
    Sit with me.
    -> kasha_t4_c9_b2

* [TWITCH] #delta:0 #expr:neutral #icon:curiosity
    ...
    Yeah.
    I am.
    ...
    It's okay. I'll be normal again in a second.
    Just — don't make it harder.
    -> kasha_t4_c9_b2

* [DRIFT] #delta:4 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation
    ...
    Stop.
    ...
    Stop being good at this. It's annoying.
    ...
    Don't stop.
    -> kasha_t4_c9_b2

* [REEL] #delta:4 #expr:warm #icon:warmth #flag:mood.kasha.callback_first_day
    ...
    ...
    You said that to me on the first day.
    I almost left.
    ...
    I'm glad I didn't.
    -> kasha_t4_c9_b2


=== kasha_t4_c9_b2 ===
Here is a fact.
When I came here.
I came here because somewhere else, I was second.
...
I was second to a memory.
Of someone who wasn't there anymore.
And I couldn't compete with a memory because memories don't have flaws.
I could only ever be a worse version of someone who wasn't there.
...
So I left.
I came here. And I made up a championship I could win.
Because here, there was nobody to be second to.
...
Until you showed up.

* [WAIT] #delta:5 #expr:warm #icon:warmth #flag:secret.kasha.told_the_truth
    ...
    ...
    Yeah.
    I knew you wouldn't say anything.
    That's why I told you.
    -> END

* [TWITCH] #delta:1 #expr:neutral #icon:curiosity
    Pff.
    Yeah.
    I know.
    ...
    Don't make me say more.
    I'm done for today.
    -> END

* [DRIFT] #delta:4 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation #flag:mood.kasha.thanked_softly
    ...
    I know.
    ...
    I knew before you said it.
    But — yeah.
    It's still nice to hear.
    ...
    Thank you, baka.
    -> END

* [REEL] #delta:1 #expr:neutral #icon:curiosity #flag:mood.kasha.no_qualifier
    ...
    Don't say 'here' like that.
    Like there's a 'here' and an 'elsewhere.'
    ...
    Just say I'm not second.
    Say it without the qualifier.
    -> END

Okay.
I've been thinking about this all day.
Don't comment on that.
I'm going to say a thing. And then another thing. And then a third thing.
Don't interrupt me. Please.
...Yeah, I said please. We are past that, you and I.

* [WAIT] #delta:5 #expr:warm #icon:warmth #flag:secret.kasha.real_name_given
    ...
    Good.
    Thank you.
    ...
    First thing.
    My name is not Kasha.
    ...
    Kasha is a thing I called myself when I came here.
    It means 'fire-cart.' I thought it sounded fierce.
    It does sound fierce. But it isn't my name.
    ...
    My name is Aki.
    It just means 'autumn.'
    I have always thought it was too soft.
    ...
    I am telling it to you anyway.
    -> kasha_t5_c10_b2

* [TWITCH] #delta:-3 #expr:neutral #icon:curiosity #flag:mood.kasha.real_name_rushed
    ...
    ...
    Don't do that to me. Not today.
    ...
    Fine. Skipping.
    I'm Aki.
    That's the first thing.
    -> kasha_t5_c10_b2

* [DRIFT] #delta:5 #expr:warm #icon:warmth #flag:secret.kasha.real_name_given
    ...
    I will.
    Thank you.
    ...
    First thing.
    My name is Aki.
    Kasha is a thing I called myself.
    Aki is what I was first.
    -> kasha_t5_c10_b2

* [REEL] #delta:5 #expr:warm #icon:warmth #flag:secret.kasha.real_name_given
    ...
    Aki.
    That's my name.
    ...
    Don't say it back yet.
    Wait till I'm done.
    -> kasha_t5_c10_b2


=== kasha_t5_c10_b2 ===
Second thing.
I've been calling you 'baka' since the first day.
I never picked a real name for you.
...
I'm going to.
...
I'm going to call you Hikaru.
It means 'light.'
Don't say anything yet.
I picked it because the first time I ever caught myself smiling about you, you weren't there.
It was morning.
Light through the leaves.
I thought of you.
...
That is the most embarrassing thing I have ever said.
We are not going to talk about it.

* [WAIT] #delta:4 #expr:warm #icon:warmth #flag:mood.kasha.named_him #flag:kasha.release_ready
    ...
    Thank you for not saying anything.
    ...
    Hikaru.
    I'm going to use that now.
    Get used to it.
    -> kasha_t5_c10_b3

* [TWITCH] #delta:-2 #expr:neutral #icon:curiosity #flag:kasha.release_ready
    ...
    DON'T.
    Don't make fun of it.
    I picked it. It's mine. It's yours. Don't make it weird.
    ...
    Ugh. Now I'm second-guessing it.
    Too late. Decision made. You are Hikaru.
    -> kasha_t5_c10_b3

* [DRIFT] #delta:4 #expr:warm #icon:warmth #flag:kasha.release_ready
    ...
    ...
    Don't say my name back yet.
    Just — Hikaru. Yes. That.
    Good.
    -> kasha_t5_c10_b3

* [REEL] #delta:4 #expr:warm #icon:warmth #flag:kasha.release_ready
    ...
    Yes.
    ...
    Yes you will.
    -> kasha_t5_c10_b3


=== kasha_t5_c10_b3 ===
Third thing.
...
I never wanted to be the champion of this corner.
I wanted to be somebody's favourite person.
...
I am yours.
Aren't I.
...
Don't answer.
I know.
