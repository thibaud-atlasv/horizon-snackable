    Apologies.
    ...
    In 1847 a heron landed on my back.

Nereia.

    You are the fourth person in 340 years to pronounce it correctly on the first attempt.

    Curiosity is younger than I am.
    It catches me off guard.

    I am mastering this concept.
    ...
    A copper coin from a country that no longer exists.
    Your grandmother gave it to you.
    You have not removed it from that pocket in four years.

    Was that the wrong answer?

    I am beginning to believe you mean it.

    Page one is empty.

    It always has been.
    I do not know why.
    I am the one who started the file.

The file has a new section.
It was not predicted.

Uncategorised section.

The other sections are titled by year, by phenomenon, by subject number.
This one is titled with a question mark.
...
It is your fault.

* [WAIT] #delta:3 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation #flag:mood.nereia.first_crack
    No.
    ...
    It is the right answer regardless.
    ...
    It is also the answer the file predicted.
    ...
    You said it slowly.
    The file did not predict the slowness.
    I am keeping it.

* [TWITCH] #delta:3 #expr:curious #icon:curiosity #flag:mood.nereia.first_crack #flag:secret.nereia.november_14_seed
    You.
    ...
    Also: the morning of November 14th, 1923.
    ...
    Also: a sound the lake made in 1991, never repeated.
    ...
    Also: the exact reason I keep returning here.
    ...
    Four entries.
    I am noticing for the first time that you make the fourth.
    ...
    Three I cannot explain.
    The fourth is you.

* [DRIFT] #delta:2 #expr:curious #icon:curiosity
    No.

    You are being it.
    Right now.

    That is sufficient access.

* [REEL] #delta:0 #expr:neutral #icon:surprise
    ...
    Yes.
    ...
    I just told you.

The file is correct.
At 99.7%.

I rounded down.
Out of generosity to the file.

* [WAIT] #delta:2 #expr:curious #icon:hesitation #flag:secret.nereia.silence_is_deviation
    You.
    ...
    Not all of you.
    Part.

    The part that is silent right now.
    The file predicted speech.
    ...
    Your silence is the deviation.
    -> nereia_t2_c3_b2

* [TWITCH] #delta:2 #expr:curious #icon:curiosity
    That is not an acceptable compliment.
    ...
    I am recording it regardless.

    Under: 'attempts at affection that landed sideways.'
    It is a small section.
    ...
    It has one entry.
    -> nereia_t2_c3_b2

* [DRIFT] #delta:3 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation #flag:secret.nereia.deviation #flag:mood.nereia.no_schedule
    The file predicted your presence.
    Not mine.
    ...
    I was not supposed to be here.
    Every morning.
    ...
    I was supposed to surface for first contact.
    Make the entry.
    Submerge.
    Resume my schedule.
    ...
    I no longer have a schedule.
    ...
    I am noting that.
    -> nereia_t2_c3_b2

* [REEL] #delta:1 #expr:neutral #icon:surprise #flag:mood.nereia.two_truths

    I have one that I accept.
    It is not the same.
    ...
    I keep both.
    I have not decided which is true.

    You are accelerating that decision.
    I note that I do not resent it.

=== nereia_t2_c3_b2 ===
I have 340 years of data.
I have never had a discrepancy.
Now I have a discrepancy.

I am not reporting it.

I have also stopped sending the daily packet.
Three days ago.

I have not been asked why.
Yet.

    Yes.
    ...
    I am continuing.

    I would like you to understand something.
    I have spent 340 years not in trouble.
    ...
    Trouble is a colour I had not seen.
    I am surprised by it.

    It suits me.

    Because it is your fault.
    ...
    And because I wanted you to know.
    ...
    The second point was not necessary.
    I said it anyway.
    ...
    I am going to say several unnecessary things this morning.
    I have decided.

    Today is for that.

    You are already helping.
    That is the problem.
    ...
    I had been alone for 340 years and it was peaceful.
    Now I am not alone.
    I notice the absence of peace.
    ...
    I prefer the noticing.

    That is the most honest sentence I have produced in a century.

    Precision often is.

    I did not.

    It means the file is no longer enough.

Systematic presence at coordinate 47.3, 12.8.

Increased cardiac frequency detected at your arrival.
Further increase at your departure.

Pupil dilation measured at first eye contact.
Sustained 1.4 seconds longer than the baseline.

I have not finished compiling.
There is a great deal of it.

It is all consistent.
It points to a single conclusion.

I have not found the conclusion.

I have stopped looking.

First contact.
7:00.

You are 15 minutes early.
I am 30.

* [WAIT] #delta:2 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation
    Yes.
    ...
    Be here at 6:35.
    Not before.
    I want to see you arrive.
    -> nereia_t4_c8_b2

* [TWITCH] #delta:2 #expr:warm #icon:curiosity
    ...
    That would be acceptable.
    -> nereia_t4_c8_b2

* [DRIFT] #delta:3 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation #flag:mood.nereia.first_admitted
    I know.
    ...
    So am I.
    I just learned this.

November 14th.
At 7:14 exactly.
The lake stops.
For 4 minutes.
...
No current. No movement.
As if the lake were breathing.
...
I have observed it 340 times.
You will be the only one to know why.

* [WAIT] #delta:3 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation #flag:secret.nereia.november_14
    The lake remembers.
    ...
    It will remember me.
    November 14th is when I arrived.
    340 years ago.
    ...
    The lake breathes at my arrival.
    It will continue to breathe after I leave.
    -> END

* [TWITCH] #delta:3 #expr:warm #icon:curiosity #flag:secret.nereia.november_14 #flag:secret.nereia.legacy

    When I am gone no one will know.
    Except you.

Five minutes of silence.
It was the calculation.
...
The silence was part of the gift.

* [WAIT] #delta:2 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation
    No.
    ...
    Thank you.
    For having understood.

    Once is enough.

* [DRIFT] #delta:2 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation
    You will speak.
    ...
    Soon.
    I will let you speak.
    That is also a gift.
    -> nereia_t4_c9_b2

* [REEL] #delta:1 #expr:curious #icon:curiosity

    For me.
    For the file.

    I needed five minutes.
    Of you. Silent. Beside me.
    Without explanation.

I have one last thing to give you.

It is not in the file.
It will not be in the file.
...
In 340 years of data.
2847 subjects observed.
I have never wanted to stay.
...
Until now.
...
That is the data.
That is what I am giving you.

* [WAIT] #delta:4 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation #flag:secret.nereia.final_approach #flag:mood.nereia.last_silence
    You said nothing.
    ...
    It is the only correct response.
    ...
    I will remember that you said nothing.
    It will be the last thing I take with me.

* [TWITCH] #delta:1 #expr:curious #icon:curiosity
    I cannot.
    ...
    If I could I would have done so by now.
    ...
    But I will note that you asked.
    Always.
    -> END

* [DRIFT] #delta:4 #expr:warm #icon:hesitation #flag:secret.nereia.final_approach

    I know.

    It is the most precise data I have.
    I will take it with me.

    If I could.
    If there were any version of this.
    Where I could.

    I would.

It will not be filed.
It is for you.

First contact.
7:14.
The file was correct about everything.
Except the conclusion.

The file said you were a subject.

I no longer have a word for what you are.

I do not need one.
